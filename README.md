# DrawItOrLoseItProject
The Gaming Room, which is our client first reach out to us to expand their Draw It or Lose It. They currently have it on Android platform and they wanted 
to expand to all the platforms. They wanted us to design a web-based application for this game. So, everyone around the world can play on their web browser 
and it won't be dependent on the platforms  the users are using. While developing the software design document, I particularly did well explaining 
the differences between hosting web-based application on different server Operating System platforms. Design document give you a clear view of 
what you are building for the client and it helps you to stay on track and focus. If I have to revise one part of design document,  
I would choose the Recommendation section because I believe I could written more about each of the suggestion I made instead of briefly discussing them. 
I thoroughly reviewed the requirements and understand the important points that can be incorporated into Software Design documents. Clients always comes 
first whenver designing software documents. Make sure to make time with the clients if I don't understand some concepts or requirements. I break down the problems
into small pieces when designing software. I would use the Object Oriented approach whenever  I am desinging software and in future I will use this same technique.
